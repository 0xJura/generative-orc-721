# Generative ORC-721 Protocol / Standard for Bitcoin & Co.

Author:  Gerald Bauer (Punk's Not Dead, Learn Pixel Art, et al)



Let's deploy a new 10 000 d.i.y. punk (pixel head) collection
in 8 seconds ;-) - yes, you can. Example:


``` json
{
    "p": "orc-721",
    "op": "deploy",
    "slug": "diypunks",
    "name": "D.I.Y. Punks",
    "supply": 10000,
    "size": "24x24",
    "generative": "<spritesheet/art layers inscription id here>"
}
```

That's it. Ready to mint:

``` json
```



Where's the catch?   Step 0: To make  it work you can (re)use
existing inscribed spritesheets / art layers or inscribe your very own.
Read on.

##  Design

What's different compared to Generative BRC-721 (by Jerry Fanelli)?

Three main ideas:

1) Make it (even) easier
2) Use less bytes (and, thus, save on inscription fees)
3) Many more options (and less restrictions / requirements)
